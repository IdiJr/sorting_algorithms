# 0x1B C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
This projects covers the concepts of sorting algoritms and was a project done alongside [Emmanuel Addo](https://github.com/emmanueladdo) as my partner.

At the end of this project, We were able to achieve:
  
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
